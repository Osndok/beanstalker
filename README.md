This is a Maven plugin for Interop with AWS Services. In particular:

  * [AWS Elastic Beanstalk](http://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/)
  * [Amazon CloudFront](http://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/)
  * [Amazon SimpleDB](http://aws.amazon.com/simpledb/)

It also constains a handy archetype for a RESTful Web Service under AWS EB.
